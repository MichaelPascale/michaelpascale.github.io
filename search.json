    "text": "Hello! I am a doctoral student in the Cognition and Decision Lab at Boston University.\nMy research is concerned with decision-making in the context of human information behavior, which I approach from the perspective of computational cognitive neuroscience. This primarily includes information seeking and exploration, two kinds of behavior which are influenced by curiosity, uncertainty, model-based learning, and valuation processes. On a broader scale, I am particularly interested how these aspects of individual psychology impact social epistemology and the acquisition of knowledge as a human social endeavour.\nI also am an avid evangelist for the open source movement, contributing to Wikipedia and to software tools in the social sciences."

    "text": "Often when reaching a milestone — say, just after the new year or upon starting a new job — I spend (more than) a few hours of time excitedly putting together calendars and note-taking systems, in the name of reorganizing my life. While this behavior is usually little more than procrastination, cleverly disguised as efficiency and probably serving my instant gratification monkey more than my long term goals, I like to think that it is at least somewhat a process of iterative and creative self-improvement. Most times I engage in this improvement, I buy a few pens and notebooks, a whiteboard, index cards, or other physical writing formats.\nWell, rather than spending hours of my life drawing, this time I decided to type.\nThe programming and graphics facilities provided by R make it an excellent choice for generation of scientific figures and reports. Certainly it wouldn’t be difficult to print custom calendars too?"

    "text": "In my quest to manage my personal knowledge, I have simply found it very difficult to commit to one notebook, device, word processor, etc. From the wealth of “second-brain” applications, I’ve tried (and enjoyed) Obsidian, LogSeq, and Zettlr. The capacity that these applications offer to search and — especailly — to link peices of knowledge, I have found to be very desirable.\nDespite my efforts however, I cannot shake my habit of taking notes on whatever medium is convenient to me. A laptop is a must-have for meetings, but can be cumbersome when I’m out in public. A physical journal suits my quiet moments best. My phone is the only convenient medium on the train.\nThis document outlines my plan for Spellkast, my personal software project for managing a digital Zettlekasten. The aim of Spellkast is to compile a searchable database of timestamped and indexed notes from the collection of disparate media I write on."

    "text": "Idiosyncratic Constraints\nThe software will need to handle the following idiosyncracies of my notetaking style.\n\nDocument Headings\nI have cultivated the habit of writing an ISO 8601 format timestamp and my location (e.g. “At Home”) on every document and note.\n\n\nAll Caps\nI handwrite in all caps.\nYes, it’s less efficient than cursive and it’s less readable than print, but — for my impatient hand — it is the most legible. The software could potentially apply either an LLM or a simple sentence case case mapping conversion to normalize handwritten inputs.\n\n\nCornell-Tufte Style\nI’ve also cultivated a habit of journaling in what I call Cornell-Tufte format. That is, I take notes in the Cornell style, modified to include a right margin for asides and for graphics in the style of Edward Tufte. The right margin excuses me to write down intrusive thoughts, allowing me to quickly return my focus to the topic at hand."

Text is read off the cards using Tesseract.\n\n\nJournal Entries\nI’m not yet sure the best way to catalogue my Journal entries. They may be digitized using my phone camera, weekly scans, or in bulk when I complete the journal. As the entries are timestamped, it is not important that they be scanned in order."

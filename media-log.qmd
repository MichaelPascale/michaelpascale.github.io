This page is a list of things I have read, watched, or otherwise engaged with. It's not necessarily a list of favorites, preferences, or recommendations, but rather like a personal reading log with the following purposes:

1) To note for my own personal record, revisitation, and quick reference
2) To share with others who find themselves exploring similar domains of existence

That I have shared an author or topic here is not an endorsement.

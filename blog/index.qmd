A blog (or the original [_weblog_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#Origins), as I prefer) is something I see as a place for one to be themselves, through which to cultivate and refine themselves over time. As such, my prose here is often raw and unedited; you may find these writings to be more for me than for you. Nevertheless, I do still hope some of my activity may be useful or interesting to others.

My blog posts are also living documents. That is, the published date reflects the date first published, though posts may have been modified since. [Link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) irks me, so hopefully I'm keeping external references up to date --- I very much intend for URLs to work long into the future.

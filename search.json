    "text": "Often when reaching a milestone — say, just after the new year or upon starting a new job — I spend (more than) a few hours of time excitedly putting together calendars and note-taking systems, in the name of reorganizing my life. While this behavior is usually little more than procrastination, cleverly disguised as efficiency and probably serving my instant gratification monkey more than my long term goals, I like to think that it is at least somewhat a process of iterative and creative self-improvement. Most times I engage in this improvement, I buy a few pens and notebooks, a whiteboard, index cards, or other physical writing formats.\nWell, rather than spending hours of my life drawing, this time I decided to type.\nThe programming and graphics facilities provided by R make it an excellent choice for generation of scientific figures and reports. Certainly it wouldn’t be difficult to print custom calendars too?"

I am a first year doctoral student in the Cognition and Decision Lab at Boston University.\nMy research is concerned with decision-making in the context of information behavior, which I approach from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience. This primarily includes information seeking and how it is influenced by curiosity and valuation processes. I am particularly interested social epistemology and the acquisition of knowledge as a human social endeavour.\nI also contribute to open source software in the social sciences."

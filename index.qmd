Hello! I am a doctoral student in the [Cognition and Decision Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/cdlab/) at Boston University.

My research is concerned with human [information behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_behavior), which I approach from the perspective of computational cognitive neuroscience. Of particular interest to me are those [information seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_seeking) and exploratory behaviors which appear to be curiosity-driven.

Curiosity is a state of being with deep cultural significance [@papastephanou2019], attended to by many generations of philosophers and several generations of psychologists [@james1918] [@berlyne1954] [@loewenstein1994]. Only recently is it possible to integrate these efforts with cognitive neuroscience [@kidd2015] [@cervera2020], wherein the past fourty years[^3] of work has yielded insight into the neural underpinnings of motivation and decision-making. The study of curiosity brings up many questions evocative of [neuroepistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroepistemology) [@churchland2004] and [neuroaesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroesthetics).

- How does our experience of curiosity, and the conditions under which we exhibit it, improve or impair our ability to find truth?
- Why is it that particular information content or presentation promotes curious states more or less than others?
- To what extent do nonhuman animals exhibit exploratory behavior that resembles human curiosity-driven behavior?

On a broader scale, I am particularly interested how these aspects of individual psychology impact [social epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_epistemology) and the acquisition of knowledge as a human [social endeavor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology_of_scientific_knowledge).

I also am an avid supporter of the open source movement, contributing to free texts and to software tools in the social sciences. Generally I welcome solicitations for tutoring or free software work.

    "text": "My roommate and I saw a bulletin board in a coffee shop built on an LED matrix. Maybe it would be nice to design our own!\n\n\n\nThe final product. Wow it was hot out in June!\n\n\nOur plan was to use a Raspberry Pi 4B as the controller. We debated between an eInk and and LED matrix.\n\n\n\nItem\nCritical Length (mm)\nCritical Width (mm)\nDescription\nLink\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\n192.00\n192.00\nSquare, 64x64, RGB LED Matrix\nAmazon\n\n\nDisplay\n114.90\n85.80\n600x448, eInk, Color, 5.65”, 50mW\nAmazon\n\n\n\nThe LED matrix was closer to the vibe we were going for, and it turned out to be much cheaper. Next we needed to find an appropriate frame.\n\n\n\nItem\nCritical Length (mm)\nCritical Width (mm)\nDescription\nLink\n\n\n\n\nFrame\n152.40\n152.40\nSquare, rounded edges, cherry\nAmazon\n\n\nFrame\n152.00\n203.00\nMultiple Sizes and orientations, beechwood\nEtsy\n\n\nFrame\n203.00\n253.00\nMultiple Sizes and orientations, walnut\nEtsy\n\n\nFrame\n254.00\n127.00\n5”x10” Floating Canvas Frame, Deep\nEtsy\n\n\nFrame\n254.00\n127.00\n5”x10” Colorful wood\nEtsy\n\n\n\nSo that we could collaboratively a draw pixel art icon set, I set up conditional formatting in a Google sheet such that the number in each cell determined the color. Then I wrote a Python script to convert the numeric matrix to a set of PNG images.\n\n\n\nPixel art in a Google Sheet using conditional formatting.\n\n\nUsing the LED Matrix driver written by Henner Zeller, I wrote some code to pull weather information from OpenWeather at regular intervals and draw the date and time to the screen (GitHub).\n\n\n\nMight want to make those icons a little smaller…\n\n\nFuture additions may include rotating widgets in the right panel, specifically with data on train arrivals from the MBTA’s API."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are several newsletters and promotional lists whose emails pollute my Gmail inbox. Although unsubscribing could easily solve this problem, there are certain companies whose promotions I do sometimes like to receive. Whether it’s to keep up on local events or the latest email exclusive deals, there is usually not much reason to retain these messages for more than a week or two, and so I tend to do a time-consuming, manual, bulk search-and-delete every few months.\nTo recoup this time, I put together a simple Google AppScript which allows me to set a retention policy per-address on these promotional mailings. New rules are easily added as a new row in a Google Sheet, which I keep bookmarked.\n\n\n\nThe retention policy is defined in a Google Sheet. Add a row with the address to check and number of days to retain. Apply data validation criteria in Google Sheets to check for valid addresses and to include the dropdown for number of days.\n\n\nThe AppScript reads from the policy sheet and filters through my Gmail Inbox, accordingly moving conversations to the trash.\nconst DAY_MS = (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)\nconst SHEET_ID = \"ymjPzDSUCMsbNLvCSVzx9y6kfumNWY5o\" // &lt;-- Replace with your spreadsheet ID (in the Google Sheet URL).\n\nfunction retrievePolicy(){\n  const ss  = SpreadsheetApp.openById(SHEET_ID)\n  return ss.getSheetByName('RetentionPolicy').getSheetValues(2,1,1000,2).filter(row =&gt; row[0] != \"\")\n}\n\nfunction applyRetentionPolicy () {\n  const pol = retrievePolicy()\n  const today = new Date()\n\n  for (rule of pol) {\n    const cnvs = GmailApp.search(`from:${rule[0]}`)\n    console.log(`Apply rule {from: ${rule[0]}, keep: ${rule[1]}} to ${cnvs.length} conversations.`)\n    \n    if (rule[1] == 'indefinitely')\n      continue\n    \n    if (rule[1].endsWith('days')) {\n      const ndays = Number(rule[1].replace(/\\D/g, ''))\n      const ndays_ago = new Date()\n      ndays_ago.setDate(ndays_ago.getDate() - ndays)\n\n      for (cnv of cnvs) {\n        if (cnv.getLastMessageDate() &lt; ndays_ago) {\n          const age = Math.ceil((today - cnv.getLastMessageDate()) / DAY_MS)\n          console.log(`  Deleting conversation \"${cnv.getFirstMessageSubject()}\" (${age} days old)`)\n          cnv.moveToTrash()\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n  }\n}\nClick run, and there go all those old promotions…\n\n\n\nThe AppScript excecution log records which messages were trashed. Goodbye junk mail!\n\n\nFinally, a custom trigger runs the script every Monday morning, so I can start my week with a fresh inbox.\n\n\n\nAppScript allows you to set “app triggers” with which you can set your script to run automatically at regular intervals."

The capacity that these applications offer to search and — especailly — to link peices of knowledge, I have found to be very desirable.\nDespite my efforts however, I cannot shake my habit of taking notes on whatever medium is convenient to me. A laptop is a must-have for meetings, but can be cumbersome when I’m out in public. A physical journal suits my quiet moments best. My phone is the only convenient medium on the train.\nThis document outlines my plan for Spellkast, my personal software project for managing a digital Zettlekasten. The aim of Spellkast is to compile a searchable database of timestamped and indexed notes from the collection of disparate media I write on."

The software could potentially apply either an LLM or a simple sentence case case mapping conversion to normalize handwritten inputs.\n\n\nCornell-Tufte Style\nI’ve also cultivated a habit of journaling in what I call Cornell-Tufte format. That is, I take notes in the Cornell style, modified to include a right margin for asides and for graphics in the style of Edward Tufte. The right margin excuses me to write down intrusive thoughts, allowing me to quickly return my focus to the topic at hand."

    "text": "Hello! I am a doctoral student in the Cognition and Decision Lab at Boston University.\nMy research is concerned with human information behavior, which I approach from the perspective of computational cognitive neuroscience. Of particular interest to me are those information seeking and exploratory behaviors which appear to be curiosity-driven.\nCuriosity is a state of being with deep cultural significance1, attended to by many generations of philosophers and several generations of psychologists2 34. Only recently is it possible to integrate these efforts with cognitive neuroscience5 6, wherein the past fourty years1 of work has yielded insight into the neural underpinnings of motivation and decision-making. The study of curiosity brings up many questions evocative of neuroepistemology and neuroaesthetics.\nOn a broader scale, I am particularly interested how these aspects of individual psychology impact social epistemology and the acquisition of knowledge as a human social endeavor.\nI also am an avid supporter of the open source movement, contributing to free texts and to software tools in the social sciences. Generally I welcome solicitations for tutoring or free software work."
